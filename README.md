# Name-Entity-Recognition-NER-

## Description:        
This GitHub repository contains a web-based Name Entity Recognition (NER) app developed using Flask and SpaCy. The app enables users to upload text files and perform entity recognition in English or Spanish. It leverages SpaCy's pre-trained language models to deliver accurate and real-time NER results.
                
## Features:           
         
- User-friendly web interface with file upload and language selection.             
- Support for English and Spanish language recognition using SpaCy.            
- Responsive design and error handling for smooth user experience.              
- Easily extensible to include additional language support by integrating SpaCy models.            
- Clean and well-documented codebase for easy understanding and customization.                 
          
## How to Use:                

- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.             
- Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.              
- Run the Flask app with python app.py.
